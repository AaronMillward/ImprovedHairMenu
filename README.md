## Known Issues
### Vanilla Bugs
#### Stubble doesn't save in character presets
The stubble tick boxes aren't considered in the preset saving code.
#### AllClothesUnlocked duplicates some clothing menus
If you get to the character screen without enabling `AllClothesUnlocked` then go back to enable it some clothing menus will be duplicated. this is a vanilla bug so is lower priority for fixing. it doesn't affect what your character is wearing it's just a UI bug.
